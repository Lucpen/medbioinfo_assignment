Assignment 1: Working on the command line
Introduction to Unix

Solve these assignments in a terminal window, and perhaps using a browser.

1. Figure out what the following Unix commands do. You should feel familiar will all of these:
cd
ls
mkdir
rm
cat
less
head
tail
wc
grep
sort
uniq
cut

2. Create a directory structure for this course in your home directory using mkdir and cd. There should be a directory for the course, and within it a directory for each assignment.

3. Use the man command to figure out…
… what the command “ls -l” does.
… how you delete a directory and its contents with rm.

4. Download our GPCR data file (with data concerning G-protein coupled receptors from a number of species) into your course directory and apply the commands from question 1 to answer the following questions. Note: this is about practicing working on the command line!
How many columns are there (if you count by eye)?
How many lines is there in the file?
Use grep and wc to find out how many human GPCRs there are listed. Use techniques from Chapter 5! Do you search for “human” or “Homo sapiens”?
How long is the shortest sequence listed in the same file? Use cut and sort!
How many species are named in gpcr.tab?

5. Download and extract a directory with Fasta files, that contains 88 Fasta files. Write a shell script that applies a multi alignment software like Muscle or MAFFT (install as necessary!) on each gene family in the directory.
